Hi there! I'm Mia, a second-year undergrad at Colorado State University. I'm pursuing a B.S. in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability, with minors in Geospatial Information Science and Conservation Biology. While my academic pursuits lie in improving the well-being of our planet and its wildlife, I am also passionate about music and the arts, and am a volunteer puppy raiser for Canine Companions.
