## Knapp Research Lab

I am currently employed as an undergraduate research assistant in the Knapp Lab (Colorado State University Department of Biology), and have been a part of multiple research projects.

-   Salsola Removal & Recovery Experiment (SRRE) Project

    -   Presented findings at Front Range Student Ecology Symposium (FRSES) 2025 and CURC 2025.

    -   Accepted to Ecological Society of America (ESA) Conference 2025.

    -   Assisted with measurements of productivity, light availability, and water availability.

    -   Established and maintained study plots over the growing season.

-   Drought Recovery Experiment (DRE) Project

    -   Assisted with continued measurements such as phenology, soil moisture, and soil respiration.

## ESS 330

In the Spring of 2025 I took a class Quantitative Reasoning class based in R. I wrote some code, and did some cool data science. Here is a collection of links and results from various labs!

### Lab 1: Building a personal portfolio website

-   In this assignment we built a site for personal and professional use with Github Pages.
-   This is the website you're currently on! Take a look around at the Projects, Resume, and About Me pages.

### Lab 2: Minnesota Tree Growth

-   For this lab, we used a CSV file of tree growth data to determine various statistics of the trees.

-   For example, we found tree species with the highest mean age or fastest growth speed.

-   Pictured are some of the species we focused on, as well as a tibble with results of one of the tests.

### Lab 3: COVID Wrangling

-   In this lab, we used both historical and current COVID-19 data to create a variety of informational graphics.
-   Tools like these could be utilized in crisis situations where effective data communication is crucial.
-   Attached are some of the resulting graphs:

### Lab 4: Statistics in R

-   In this statistics-based lab, we played with more of the mathematical functions that R has to offer.
-   We created a variety of types of graphs, displayed a multitude of data. Some of the resulting figures are included below:

### Lab 5: Final Project Proposals

-   In this assignment, we came up with a variety of environmental project ideas, and did some research to find suitable data.
-   We searched multiple databases for suitable data, and came up with ideas ranging from air pollutants to bird migration. Ultimately we decided to focus on how climate change could affect bird migrations, specifically for the American Bittern (pictured below).

### Lab 7: Final Projects Intro and Methods

-   In this next step for our final project, we began to draft the written portions of our report, as well as start with some data cleaning and analysis. I primarily worked on the background research and writing portions.
-   Here's what part of our writing document looked like!

### Lab 9: Final Project Results and Discussion

-   After completing our data analysis, we interpreted our findings and what they could mean for the ecological community.
-   Here is one of our figures, which was ultimately included in our lightning presentation:

### Lab 11: Final Project Lightning Talks

-   For this assignment, my project partner and I presented an abridged version of our research. We primarily discussed the motivations, methods, and results.
-   Here are some key slides from our presentation:
