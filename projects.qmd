## Knapp Research Lab

I am currently employed as an undergraduate research assistant in the Knapp Lab (Colorado State University Dept. of Biology), and have been a part of multiple research projects.

-   Salsola Removal & Recovery Experiment (SRRE) Project

    -   Presented findings at Front Range Student Ecology Symposium (FRSES) 2025 and CURC 2025.

    -   Assisted with measurements of productivity, light availability, and water availability.

    -   Established and maintained study plots.

-   Drought Recovery Experiment (DRE) Project

    -   Assisted with continued measurements such as phenology, soil moisture,
